The bordered system

`f` is the state, and may be any array. For a 2D problem it is natural to keep the
state as a matrix, and nothing here requires it to be flattened into a vector.

`b` and `c` live in the same space as the state, so for a width-1 border they have the
same shape as `f`, and `d` and `g` are scalars.

For a border of width `m > 1`, pass `b` and `c` as a tuple (or vector) of `m` states,
`d` as an `m x m` matrix and `g` as a length-`m` vector. The width is taken from that
structure and never inferred from an array's shape, since a state can itself be a
matrix and the two cannot be told apart otherwise.

`J` is only ever applied and solved against, so it can be a matrix or a matrix-free
operator; no assumption is made about its shape.

`v` solves the state block and has the same shape as the state. `σ` solves the border
block, a scalar for a width-1 border. `retcode` is the `ReturnCode` of the underlying
`LinearSolve` solve, so a failure in the inner solver is visible rather than absorbed.
