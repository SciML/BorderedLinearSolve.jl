where `J` is `n x n` and the border `b`, `c` is `n x m` with `m` small (usually 1).
Systems of this shape come up in continuation and bifurcation work, where `J` is the
Jacobian of a large system and the border carries a handful of extra constraints.

The point of solving them this way rather than assembling the whole `(n+m) x (n+m)`
matrix is that every inner solve uses the *same* `J`, so one `LinearSolve` cache serves
them all, and it carries over between outer steps where `J` changes only slightly. That
is what makes factorization or Krylov subspace reuse available here.
